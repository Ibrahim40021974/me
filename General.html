    <p><h1> All about me! </h1>
      <big><big><strong>I have a strong fascination with mathematics. A fascination that I perhaps owe to my mother who encouraged me to study it extensively. Mathematics attracts me because of its absoluteness and perfection or maybe because I love that subject. I have participated in several mathematics competitions and have performed quite good at many of them. Another area of interest that I possess is robotics and computers. I have done a summer course in robotics and have had the opportunity to learn C & C++ programming languages. I am currently working on my java programming language. My enthusiasm and activeness extend not just to academics but to other aspects of life as well. I enjoy playing sport, be it indoor or outdoor, for a team or just for fun. I have been representing my school chess team for the last seven years. I was also a part of my school basketball team for two years. Currently I play as a goalie for my school hockey team.
      I have attained two years of training as a lance corporal of the NCC contingent of my school. I was a part of the EUMIND club and the interhouse debating team. My passion for involvement in school activities has far surpassed any simple desire. All these activities could crowd out my school work but luckily enough, Iâ€™ve been able to balance my schedule rather nicely. I am ambitious to be exceptional; not one of the many ordinary students.
      I am regular at participating in Math and Science Olympiads</strong></big>.
